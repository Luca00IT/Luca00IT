# Luca00IT

Hello and welcome to my GitHUB!

My name is **Luca** and I am currently a **Computer Science and Software Engineering student**.

I am currently investing all my free time on **Game Development**, 
which I strongly believe is the perfect conjunction of creativity and logic.
I also like to make personal **Software projects** both for PC and Android/iOS.

Here you can find all my public projects that I have developed during my career.
Almost all of my software will be **Open Source**.
